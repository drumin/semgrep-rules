# Semgrep CVE Detection Rules

## Overview
This project provides a curated set of **Semgrep rules** designed to detect Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in codebases. These rules leverage Semgrep's powerful static analysis capabilities to identify patterns associated with known vulnerabilities, enabling developers and security teams to proactively secure their applications.

## Features
- **CVE Detection**: Rules target critical and high-severity CVEs across supported programming languages.
- **Reachability Analysis**: Identifies whether flagged vulnerabilities are reachable within the codebase.
- **Customizable Rules**: Extend or modify rules to suit specific project needs.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security scanning.

## Motivation
Security vulnerabilities in codebases, especially those introduced by third-party dependencies or insecure coding practices, pose significant risks. This project aims to simplify vulnerability detection by providing ready-to-use Semgrep rules tailored for CVE identification, helping developers address issues early in the development lifecycle.

## How It Works
1. **Rule Structure**: Each rule is written in YAML format and specifies:
   - The vulnerability pattern (e.g., insecure function usage).
   - Associated metadata, including CVE identifiers, severity levels, and remediation guidance.
2. **Scanning Process**:
   - Semgrep scans the codebase using the defined rules.
   - Matches are flagged with details about the vulnerability and its location.
3. **Reachability Analysis**:
   - Determines whether flagged vulnerabilities are exploitable based on data flow and usage patterns.

## Installation
1. Install Semgrep:
   ```bash
   pip install semgrep
2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/drumin/semgrep-rules.git
    cd semgrep-rules

## Usage
1. Run a scan against your codebase:
    ```bash
    semgrep --config <rule_directory> <your_code_directory>

2. View results in the terminal or export them in JSON format for integration with other tools:
    ```bash
    semgrep --config <rule_directory> <your_code_directory> --json > results.json
